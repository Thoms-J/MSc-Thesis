# MSc_Thesis


Scripts: Tools created and used for my MSc thesis

GIFs and Videos: Results and extra visualizations for parts from the Thesis Document

    - Tree Movement: Has Gifs from scan 1 and 2

    - Beach Movement: Has screencapture videos from the Livox Viewer of repetitive and non-repetitive scans of sand transport

AVIA Case STL: Has the STL files I modeled of a case that makes it possible to mount the AVIA to 1/4-20 UNC and 5/8-11 UNC threads from tripods.

    For the lid and case, I added magnets to hold the lid, these are small 1.5mm thick and 5mm in diameter magnets that should just fit with pressure, requireing no glue.
